# OLM project analysis

This repository contains code used to analyse place cell data for the paper Udakis et al 2025

- Example data is included in .mat files in the data folder these mice have mCherry expressed in OLM cells and GCaMP6f in CA1 pyramidal neurons.
- Data can be loaded and selected based on a custom data loader class 
- Each experiment contains 10 min sessions on a particular linear track, data can be aligned to each session using the data loader

To run this code we recomend creating a new python environment as described (/env_setup)[here]
